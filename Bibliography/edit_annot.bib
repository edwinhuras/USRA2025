	abstract = {This paper analyzes the emergent behaviors of pedestrian groups that learn through the multiagent reinforcement learning model developed in our group. Five scenarios studied in the pedestrian model literature, and with different levels of complexity, were simulated in order to analyze the robustness and the scalability of the model. Firstly, a reduced group of agents must learn by interaction with the environment in each scenario. In this phase, each agent learns its own kinematic controller, that will drive it at a simulation time. Secondly, the number of simulated agents is increased, in each scenario where agents have previously learnt, to test the appearance of emergent macroscopic behaviors without additional learning. This strategy allows us to evaluate the robustness and the consistency and quality of the learned behaviors. For this purpose several tools from pedestrian dynamics, such as fundamental diagrams and density maps, are used. The results reveal that the developed model is capable of simulating human-like micro and macro pedestrian behaviors for the simulation scenarios studied, including those where the number of pedestrians has been scaled by one order of magnitude with respect to the situation learned.},

@article{tweedySeeingCornersCells2020,
	abstract = {During development and metastasis, cells migrate large distances through complex environments. Migration is often guided by chemotaxis, but simple chemoattractant gradients between a source and sink cannot direct cells over such ranges. We describe how self-generated gradients, created by cells locally degrading attractant, allow single cells to navigate long, tortuous paths and make accurate choices between live channels and dead ends. This allows cells to solve complex mazes efficiently. Cells' accuracy at finding live channels was determined by attractant diffusivity, cell speed, and path complexity. Manipulating these parameters directed cells in mathematically predictable ways; specific combinations can even actively misdirect them. We propose that the length and complexity of many long-range migratory processes, including inflammation and germ cell migration, means that self-generated gradients are needed for successful navigation.},
	annotation = {\textbf{Self-generated chemotaxis:}

Self-generated chemotaxis cannot be directly measured and typically requires computational modeling to analyze. It is distinguished from classical chemotaxis by several key features:

\begin{itemize}
\item Gradients are sharp, local, and nonsaturating (unlike traditional source/sink gradients).
\item Diffusion plays a central role (in contrast to constant or linear gradients).
\item General chemotaxis is limited in effective range (500 $\mu$m) and attractant concentration.
\end{itemize}

Cells such as \textit{Dictyostelium discoideum} and metastatic cancer cells use self-generated chemotaxis to navigate complex environments (e.g., tumor tissue or migration routes). These cells degrade attractants locally using surface enzymes, resulting in dynamic gradients that help them sense and respond to upcoming junctions. This enables cells to "see around corners" and map their environment.
\\
\textbf{Junction Navigation and Model Behavior:}

\begin{itemize}
\item In classical chemotaxis, cells choose paths randomly at junctions.
\item In self-generated chemotaxis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Paths are evenly split unless one is a dead end.
\item If a branch is a dead end, only a few cells explore it. Their degradation of attractants prevents others from following.
\item Short dead ends are completely avoided: attractant gradients are dissipated before cells even arrive.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Maze Navigation:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cells navigate mazes successfully even with uniform attractant concentration.
\item Longer dead ends reduce decision fidelity.
\item Decision-making improves over time due to attractant depletion in dead ends.
\item Slower cell speeds (in simulation) improve accuracy, though this does not generalize to slower-moving cancer cells, likely due to differences in attractant diffusivity.
\item Dead ends with widening or branching structures can create "chemotactic mirages" and attract cells.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Conclusions:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Attractant flux (rate of change) is more critical for cell decisions than attractant concentration.
\item Maze geometry, especially dead end length, affects gradient strength and navigational accuracy.
\item Ligand breakdown is rarely modeled but is biologically significant and should be incorporated in future models.
\item Implications for understanding complex migration phenomena, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Neutrophil extravasation,
\item Melanoblast migration in embryonic dermis,
\item Glioblastoma metastasis along white matter tracts.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Modeling Details:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Simulations were implemented in Java.
\item Diffusion was simulated using the semi-implicit DuFort-Frankel method in a complex environment.
\item Cells followed a persistent, biased random walk informed by local gradient sensing.
\item Gradient direction was estimated from grid points within 6 $\mu$m of the cell centroid.
\item Attractant degradation followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with rate \ensuremath{r = v_{\mathrm{max}} \frac{c}{c + K_m}},
where $c$ is the local concentration and $k_m$ is the Michaelis constant.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note}: This form of chemotaxis is fundamentally different from that used by \textit{Physarum polycephalum}, which explores all paths and later prunes the least successful.

	abstract = {The symposium ``Large-scale biological phenomena arising from small-scale biophysical processes'' at the SICB 2023 Annual General Meeting focused on the cross-disciplinary exploration of emergent phenomena in biology. Interactions between cells or organisms at small scales within a system can govern patterns occurring at larger scales in space, time, or biological complexity. This theme recurs in many sub-disciplines of biology, including cell and developmental biology, evolution, and ecology. This symposium, and the associated special issue introduced here, showcases a wide range of cross-disciplinary collaborations among biologists, physicists, and engineers. Technological advancements in microscopy and microfluidics, as well as complementary advances in mathematical modeling and associated theory demonstrate the timeliness of this issue. This introduction seeks to provide useful background information to place the studies within this issue in a broader biophysical context and highlight similarities in ideas and approaches across systems and sub-disciplines. We hope to demonstrate that cross-disciplinary research linking small-scale biophysics to larger-scale emergent phenomena can help us understand problems ranging from single-cell behaviors to tissue formation and function, evolution of form, and the dynamics of communities.},

 \textbf{Collective Cell Migration in Ring Geometry:} \\
 This study explores how epithelial cells migrate collectively in annular (ring-shaped) domains. While single-cell migration is well studied, collective migration introduces complex behaviors, including leading cells, follower cohorts, and bulk movement. \\

 \textbf{Coordination Dynamics:}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Coordination was quantified using the average cross product of each cell's unit velocity vector and its radial position vector (values: +1 = clockwise, -1 = anti-clockwise, 0 = unaligned).
 \item Cells began with oscillatory motion, but coordination peaked as cell trains collided and merged.
 \item Ultimately, cells reached confluence and adopted a stable coordinated direction (either +1 or -1).
 \item Coordination degraded with proliferation due to crowding ("cell jamming"), but was preserved when cell division was limited.
 \end{itemize}

 \textbf{Train Collisions and Polarity Reversal:}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Colliding cell trains triggered directional reversal in one train via contact inhibition of locomotion.
 \item Reversal was linked to rapid polarity switching in the colliding cells.
 \item Final direction was best predicted by the size and speed of the last train to collide.
 \item Lamellipodial protrusions in leader cells were key: dominant leaders induced polarity reversal in opposing cells.
 \end{itemize}

 \textbf{Single-Cell Dynamics and Emergent Coordination:}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Cells formed unidirectional polarity gradients within the group.
 \item Follower cells developed "cryptic lamellipodia" that tucked under leading cells, enabling persistent, coordinated movement.
 \item Disrupting lamellipodia in a few cells halted global coordination.
 \item Cell‚Äìcell junctions were required for initiating, but not maintaining, collective motion.
 \item Once coordination emerged, it persisted even after physically disrupting the train or isolating cells.
 \end{itemize}

 \textbf{Simulation and Implications:}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item A simple ring-domain simulation incorporating cell polarity and adhesion reproduced experimental findings.
 \item Long-term memory of polarity emerged as a critical mechanism, decoupling sustained motion from ongoing adhesion.
 \item Highlights how single-cell dynamics shape global migration‚Äîrelevant for development, wound healing, and metastasis.

  abstract = {The directed migration of cell collectives is essential in various physiological processes, such as epiboly, intestinal epithelial turnover, and convergent extension during morphogenesis, as well as during pathological events such as wound healing and cancer metastasis. Collective cell migration leads to the emergence of coordinated movements over multiple cells. Our current understanding emphasizes that these movements are mainly driven by large-scale transmission of signals through adherens junctions. In this study, we show that collective movements of epithelial cells can be triggered by polarity signals at the single-cell level through the establishment of coordinated lamellipodial protrusions. We designed a minimalistic model system to generate one-dimensional epithelial trains confined in ring-shaped patterns that recapitulate rotational movements observed in vitro in cellular monolayers and in vivo in genital or follicular cell rotation. Using our system, we demonstrated that cells follow coordinated rotational movements after establishing directed Rac1-dependent polarity over the entire monolayer. Our experimental and numerical approaches show that the maintenance of coordinated migration requires the acquisition of a front--rear polarity within each single cell but does not require the maintenance of cell--cell junctions. Taken together, these unexpected findings demonstrate that collective cell dynamics in closed environments as observed in multiple in vitro and in vivo situations can arise from single-cell behaviour through a sustained memory of cell polarity.},

At the same time, interactions among healthy and infectious individuals may generate disease spreading if exposure time is long enough. Immunization of the population and individual awareness to contagion is considered as well. Interactions are modeled by tools of game theory, that let us propose the so-called tables of games that are introduced in the general kinetic equations. The proposed model is qualitatively studied and, through a series of case studies, we explore different scenarios related to crowding and gathering formation within indoor venues under the spread of a respiratory infectious disease, obtaining insights on specific policies to reduce contagion that may be implemented.},

  annotation = {
 \textbf{Stochastic Compass Model in Simple Environments} The authors present a simulation-based model of amoeboid chemotaxis in both open space and mazes. Cells extend pseudopods in directions biased by the gradient direction plus noise, with noise (Gaussian width) inversely proportional to gradient steepness. The closest membrane point to the internal gradient vector is selected as the new front, which is then extended and later retracted. Cell shape is governed by cortical tension, area conservation, and friction.
  \\
 \textbf{Obstacle Navigation and Cell Shape}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Protrusions are blocked at obstacle boundaries, forcing cells to extend around them.
 \item Model can be tuned for single or multiple protrusions to simulate different cell types.
 \item Navigation is effective only when obstacles are small or comparable to cell size.
 \end{itemize}

 \textbf{Maze Performance with Simple Gradient}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Maze walls were porous to chemoattractant; thus, consistent gradient formed throughout, regardless of maze structure.
 \item Perpendicular walls posed major barriers, causing cell trapping or slow movement.
 \item Low noise enabled faster but riskier movement; high noise increased exploration but reduced efficiency.
 \item Variable noise (apparently seen in \textit{Dictyostelium}) showed improved adaptability.
 \item Overall, gradient-only strategy had low success rates and was maze-structure dependent.
 \end{itemize}

 \textbf{Self-Generated Chemorepulsion}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Cells secreted a repulsive chemical to avoid previously explored regions.
 \item The repellent acted as a diffusing memory, steering cells away from traps.
 \item This strategy significantly boosted success rates (0\% to 70\%) and search efficiency.
 \end{itemize}

 \textbf{Applications and Limitations}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Relevant for cell navigation in porous extracellular matrix (ECM).
 \item Paper is purely computational; some parameters were based on prior experiments.
 \item Mazes were arbitrarily designed, though authors note small changes could drastically alter difficulty.
 It seems likely that small tweaks could be made to maze structure to significantly reduce success rates.
 \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Methods:} \\
  The cell is modeled as a chain of connected nodes that respond to internal and external forces. The direction of motion is guided by an internal compass \ensuremath{\mathrm{int}} determined by the external gradient \ensuremath{\mathrm{ext}} plus noise:

\ensuremath{\mathrm{int} = \mathrm{ext} + \eta}

where \ensuremath{\eta} is Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance inversely proportional to the chemoattractant gradient steepness.

The total force acting on each node is:

\ensuremath{F_{\mathrm{total}} = F_{\mathrm{protrusion}} + F_{\mathrm{tension}} + F_{\mathrm{pressure}} + F_{\mathrm{drag}}}

Each component of the force is defined as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \ensuremath{F_{\mathrm{protrusion}}}: Protrusive force proportional to local activation, centered on a patch aligned with the internal compass.
    \item \ensuremath{F_{\mathrm{tension}}}: Cortical tension based on curvature \ensuremath{\kappa}, membrane rigidity \ensuremath{\lambda}, and spontaneous curvature \ensuremath{\kappa_0}.
    \item \ensuremath{F_{\mathrm{pressure}}}: Restores cell area \ensuremath{A} to a constant, acting as an effective pressure.
    \item \ensuremath{F_{\mathrm{drag}}}: Damping force proportional to local velocity \ensuremath{v}, imposing speed limits.
\end{itemize}

The node motion is then given by:

\ensuremath{\frac{dr}{dt} = v = \frac{F_{\mathrm{total}}}{\gamma}}

where \ensuremath{\gamma} is the drag coefficient.

  abstract = {Background Living cells of many types need to move in response to external stimuli in order to accomplish their functional tasks; these tasks range from wound healing to immune response to fertilization. While the directional motion is typically dictated by an external signal, the actual motility is also restricted by physical constraints, such as the presence of other cells and the extracellular matrix. The ability to successfully navigate in the presence of obstacles is not only essential for organisms, but might prove relevant in the study of autonomous robotic motion. Methodology/Principal Findings We study a computational model of amoeboid chemotactic navigation under differing conditions, from motion in an obstacle-free environment to navigation between obstacles and finally to moving in a maze. We use the maze as a simple stand-in for a motion task with severe constraints, as might be expected in dense extracellular matrix. Whereas agents using simple chemotaxis can successfully navigate around small obstacles, the presence of large barriers can often lead to agent trapping. We further show that employing a simple memory mechanism, namely secretion of a repulsive chemical by the agent, helps the agent escape from such trapping. Conclusions/Significance Our main conclusion is that cells employing simple chemotactic strategies will often be unable to navigate through maze-like geometries, but a simple chemical marker mechanism (which we refer to as ``self-assistance'') significantly improves success rates. This realization provides important insights into mechanisms that might be employed by real cells migrating in complex environments as well as clues for the design of robotic navigation strategies. The results can be extended to more complicated multi-cellular systems and can be used in the study of mammalian cell migration and cancer metastasis.},

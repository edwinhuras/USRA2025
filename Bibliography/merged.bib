	abstract = {This paper proposes a kinetic theory approach coupling together the modeling of crowd evacuation from a bounded domain with exit doors and infectious disease contagion. The spatial movement of individuals in the crowd is modeled by a proper description of the interactions with people in the crowd and the environment, including walls and exits. At the same time, interactions among healthy and infectious individuals may generate disease spreading if exposure time is long enough. Immunization of the population and individual awareness to contagion is considered as well. Interactions are modeled by tools of game theory, that let us propose the so-called tables of games that are introduced in the general kinetic equations. The proposed model is qualitatively studied and, through a series of case studies, we explore different scenarios related to crowding and gathering formation within indoor venues under the spread of a respiratory infectious disease, obtaining insights on specific policies to reduce contagion that may be implemented.},

@article{jainRoleSinglecellMechanical2020,
	abstract = {The directed migration of cell collectives is essential in various physiological processes, such as epiboly, intestinal epithelial turnover, and convergent extension during morphogenesis, as well as during pathological events such as wound healing and cancer metastasis. Collective cell migration leads to the emergence of coordinated movements over multiple cells. Our current understanding emphasizes that these movements are mainly driven by large-scale transmission of signals through adherens junctions. In this study, we show that collective movements of epithelial cells can be triggered by polarity signals at the single-cell level through the establishment of coordinated lamellipodial protrusions. We designed a minimalistic model system to generate one-dimensional epithelial trains confined in ring-shaped patterns that recapitulate rotational movements observed in vitro in cellular monolayers and in vivo in genital or follicular cell rotation. Using our system, we demonstrated that cells follow coordinated rotational movements after establishing directed Rac1-dependent polarity over the entire monolayer. Our experimental and numerical approaches show that the maintenance of coordinated migration requires the acquisition of a front--rear polarity within each single cell but does not require the maintenance of cell--cell junctions. Taken together, these unexpected findings demonstrate that collective cell dynamics in closed environments as observed in multiple in vitro and in vivo situations can arise from single-cell behaviour through a sustained memory of cell polarity.},

@article{martinez-gilEmergentBehaviorsScalability2017,
	abstract = {This paper analyzes the emergent behaviors of pedestrian groups that learn through the multiagent reinforcement learning model developed in our group. Five scenarios studied in the pedestrian model literature, and with different levels of complexity, were simulated in order to analyze the robustness and the scalability of the model. Firstly, a reduced group of agents must learn by interaction with the environment in each scenario. In this phase, each agent learns its own kinematic controller, that will drive it at a simulation time. Secondly, the number of simulated agents is increased, in each scenario where agents have previously learnt, to test the appearance of emergent macroscopic behaviors without additional learning. This strategy allows us to evaluate the robustness and the consistency and quality of the learned behaviors. For this purpose several tools from pedestrian dynamics, such as fundamental diagrams and density maps, are used. The results reveal that the developed model is capable of simulating human-like micro and macro pedestrian behaviors for the simulation scenarios studied, including those where the number of pedestrians has been scaled by one order of magnitude with respect to the situation learned.},

@article{tweedySeeingCornersCells2020,
	abstract = {During development and metastasis, cells migrate large distances through complex environments. Migration is often guided by chemotaxis, but simple chemoattractant gradients between a source and sink cannot direct cells over such ranges. We describe how self-generated gradients, created by cells locally degrading attractant, allow single cells to navigate long, tortuous paths and make accurate choices between live channels and dead ends. This allows cells to solve complex mazes efficiently. Cells' accuracy at finding live channels was determined by attractant diffusivity, cell speed, and path complexity. Manipulating these parameters directed cells in mathematically predictable ways; specific combinations can even actively misdirect them. We propose that the length and complexity of many long-range migratory processes, including inflammation and germ cell migration, means that self-generated gradients are needed for successful navigation.},
	annotation = {\textbf{Self-generated chemotaxis:}

Self-generated chemotaxis cannot be directly measured and typically requires computational modeling to analyze. It is distinguished from classical chemotaxis by several key features:

\begin{itemize}
\item Gradients are sharp, local, and nonsaturating (unlike traditional source/sink gradients).
\item Diffusion plays a central role (in contrast to constant or linear gradients).
\item General chemotaxis is limited in effective range (500 $\mu$m) and attractant concentration.
\end{itemize}

Cells such as \textit{Dictyostelium discoideum} and metastatic cancer cells use self-generated chemotaxis to navigate complex environments (e.g., tumor tissue or migration routes). These cells degrade attractants locally using surface enzymes, resulting in dynamic gradients that help them sense and respond to upcoming junctions. This enables cells to "see around corners" and map their environment.
\\
\textbf{Junction Navigation and Model Behavior:}

\begin{itemize}
\item In classical chemotaxis, cells choose paths randomly at junctions.
\item In self-generated chemotaxis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Paths are evenly split unless one is a dead end.
\item If a branch is a dead end, only a few cells explore it. Their degradation of attractants prevents others from following.
\item Short dead ends are completely avoided: attractant gradients are dissipated before cells even arrive.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Maze Navigation:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cells navigate mazes successfully even with uniform attractant concentration.
\item Longer dead ends reduce decision fidelity.
\item Decision-making improves over time due to attractant depletion in dead ends.
\item Slower cell speeds (in simulation) improve accuracy, though this does not generalize to slower-moving cancer cells, likely due to differences in attractant diffusivity.
\item Dead ends with widening or branching structures can create "chemotactic mirages" and attract cells.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Conclusions:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Attractant flux (rate of change) is more critical for cell decisions than attractant concentration.
\item Maze geometry, especially dead end length, affects gradient strength and navigational accuracy.
\item Ligand breakdown is rarely modeled but is biologically significant and should be incorporated in future models.
\item Implications for understanding complex migration phenomena, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Neutrophil extravasation,
\item Melanoblast migration in embryonic dermis,
\item Glioblastoma metastasis along white matter tracts.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Modeling Details:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Simulations were implemented in Java.
\item Diffusion was simulated using the semi-implicit DuFort-Frankel method in a complex environment.
\item Cells followed a persistent, biased random walk informed by local gradient sensing.
\item Gradient direction was estimated from grid points within 6 $\mu$m of the cell centroid.
\item Attractant degradation followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with rate \ensuremath{r = v_{\mathrm{max}} \frac{c}{c + K_m}},
where $c$ is the local concentration and $k_m$ is the Michaelis constant.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note}: This form of chemotaxis is fundamentally different from that used by \textit{Physarum polycephalum}, which explores all paths and later prunes the least successful.},

	abstract = {The symposium ``Large-scale biological phenomena arising from small-scale biophysical processes'' at the SICB 2023 Annual General Meeting focused on the cross-disciplinary exploration of emergent phenomena in biology. Interactions between cells or organisms at small scales within a system can govern patterns occurring at larger scales in space, time, or biological complexity. This theme recurs in many sub-disciplines of biology, including cell and developmental biology, evolution, and ecology. This symposium, and the associated special issue introduced here, showcases a wide range of cross-disciplinary collaborations among biologists, physicists, and engineers. Technological advancements in microscopy and microfluidics, as well as complementary advances in mathematical modeling and associated theory demonstrate the timeliness of this issue. This introduction seeks to provide useful background information to place the studies within this issue in a broader biophysical context and highlight similarities in ideas and approaches across systems and sub-disciplines. We hope to demonstrate that cross-disciplinary research linking small-scale biophysics to larger-scale emergent phenomena can help us understand problems ranging from single-cell behaviors to tissue formation and function, evolution of form, and the dynamics of communities.},
